## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on a food delivery dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravmalik26/food-delivery-dataset/data). For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

1. [Data Extraction]
2. [Explanatory Data Analysis]
3. [Model Training]
  

## Problem Definition
